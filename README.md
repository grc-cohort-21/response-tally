# response-tally

An exercise for counting responses to a survey.

## Getting Started
Fork and clone this repository. You can look at the instructions from our [previous exercise](https://github.com/auberonedu/github-intro) as a reminder of how to do this. MAKE SURE TO CLONE YOUR FORK, NOT THE ORIGINAL.

## Data Format
There is a file `responses.txt` that contains the data we'll be working with. Here's what's inside it.
```
studentA maps
studentB maps
studentA lists
studentB arrays
studentC loops
studentC arrays
studentA compound
```

The first string on each line is a pseudonymous id of a student. The second string is a topic they want to know more about.

## Template Code
Look at `Tallyer.java` to see the already provided code. Take a look over it and predict what it will do when you run it.

### Running the code
1. Open your terminal in VS Code. On Mac/Linux, it should have the right type of terminal by default. On Windows, follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal) to make Git Bash the default terminal. (You do not need to do step 1 because you already have installed git).
1. Verify you are in the `response-tally` directory by running `pwd` (print working directory) on the terminal. The printed directory should end in `response-tally`.
1. Compile the Java files by running `javac src/Tallyer.java`
1. Run the main method of Tallyer by running `java -cp src Tallyer < responses.txt`

## Submitting
Once you have completed the below section (Modifying the Code), please open a Pull Request (PR). Please copy and paste your PR URL into Canvas to receive credit. Include your attempt at Wave 2, even if you did not complete it.

## Modifying the code

### Wave 1 (Required)
Implement `tallyTopics`. Read the Javadoc carefully to understand what the method is meant to do. Make sure to compile your code each time before running it!!

For the sample file, a correct output would look similar to:
```
{maps=2, lists=1, loops=1, arrays=2, compound=1}
```
The order is unimportant.

As an extra test, try downloading your class' data from Canvas and checking that your program properly handles it.

### Wave 2
Implement `tallyTopicsFiltered`. Read the Javadoc carefully to understand what the method is meant to do. Make sure to compile your code each time before running it!

For the above sample file, a correct output would look similar to:
```
{maps=1, loops=1, arrays=2}
```
The order is unimportant.

### Extra Challenges (Entirely optional)
Some more ways to exercise:
1. Display the results in sorted order
1. Robustly handle malformed files
1. Come up with some other interesting way to work with the data!
